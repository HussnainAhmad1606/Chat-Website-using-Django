# Forum-Chat-Website-using-Django
I created a chat website that contain login and registration system. The user has to sign in to the website in order to check and send messages to the website. After the user has created
the account and logged in to that account user can see other users message and also submit his/her message to the website. This Project can be used to build a community
or forum website
